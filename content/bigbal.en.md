### Level
**Level 0 - Beginner (Sat + Sun)**: You've never danced Balboa before, or you've taken a Balboa course at some point, but you need a thorough refresher. On two days you will learn the basics.

**Level 1 - Intermediate (Sat + Sun)**: You know the basic steps (Uphold, Downhold, Out&Ins, Tossout), have been dancing Balboa non-stop for about 1 year, also at Socials and parties. Now you want more! In this level you learn a lot, which builds on your basics. Even if you have been swing dancing for 3 or 4 years, there is still something to learn!

**Level 2 - Advanced (Sat + Sun)**: You have been dancing Balboa intensively for more than 3 years and attend socials almost weekly? Your basics are spot on and you can quickly incorporate new moves and steps? When the Lindy dancers are panting, your Balboa engine is fired up and even at 230 bpm you know exactly what you're doing? Get more of the fun with Mel&Jo!

**Note**: Level 1 and 2 differ in content. It is possible to register for both levels (Full Pass) if the prerequisites are met.


### Teachers

![Mel & Jo](../../mel_jo.jpg)

Mel and Jo are dance enthusiasts who dedicate their time to encourage swing dancing in the United Kingdom. Being familiar with lindy hop and blues, their current passion is mastering Balboa and Bal-swing - a journey of continuous learning.

They started salsa dancing in Singapore and after moving to the United Kingdom in 2000, they began their journey in swing dancing. After dancing lindy hop, charleston and blues for several years they then fell in love with Balboa and became dedicated to learning this dance from 2008. However, they still love and continue dancing all styles to this day.

Jo has been athletic since she was a teenager and currently holds a brown belt in Xen-Do Martial Arts. Mel, who also accomplished medals in various sports, was a break-dancer and a DJ in his younger years. From this personal experience, they apply the techniques of physical motion to help them understand and master the nature of dance movement. Both of them also currently practice Tai Chi martial arts to help with body conditioning and training.

Currently, you can find them social dancing and competing at various events across Europe and the United States. They also teach Balboa/Bal-swing throughout the United Kingdom and Europe. Their “down-to-earth” and positive attitude helps to make the classes they teach not only informative but also very enjoyable. Mel still continues his love for music as a DJ and emcee at dance events across Europe and North America.

Their aspirations to be balboa ambassadors stems from their drive to continuously learn and share the passion and knowledge of dance to enthusiasts alike.
